LZ77 is a lossless data compression algorithm developed by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977. It forms the basis for many modern compression algorithms, including ZIP, GZIP, and PNG.

How LZ77 Works
LZ77 uses a sliding window approach to replace repeating patterns with back-references to previous occurrences.

Sliding Window:

The input data is processed using a fixed-size buffer (window) that moves forward.

The window is split into:

Search buffer (past data)

Lookahead buffer (current data to encode)

Encoding Process:

The algorithm looks for the longest match between the lookahead buffer and the search buffer.

It replaces the match with a triplet (offset, length, next symbol), where:

Offset – Distance to the matching substring in the search buffer.

Length – Number of matching characters.

Next symbol – The first unmatched character after the match.

Decoding Process:

The decoder reconstructs the original data using the offset and length values.

Example
Original String:
nginx
Copy
Edit
ABABABABA
Compressed Representation (Triplets):
css
Copy
Edit
(0,0,A)   # First symbol (A)
(0,0,B)   # Next symbol (B)
(2,2,A)   # "AB" found at offset 2, length 2, next symbol A
(4,3,A)   # "ABA" found at offset 4, length 3, next symbol A
Advantages
✔️ Efficient for repetitive data
✔️ Fast decoding
✔️ Basis for many modern compression formats

Disadvantages
❌ Inefficient for short, random data
❌ Higher memory usage due to sliding window
